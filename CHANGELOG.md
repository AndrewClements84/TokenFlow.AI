## [0.6.1] â€” 2025-10-08
### ðŸ§ª Performance Regression Tracking (Benchmark Integration)
- Introduced full **BenchmarkDotNet** integration for TokenFlow.Tools.Benchmarks.
- Added **Tokenizer**, **Chunker**, and **CostEstimator** benchmark suites.
- CI workflow now:
  - Runs all benchmarks on each build.
  - Exports structured results as JSON, Markdown, and HTML.
  - Merges outputs into `benchmark-results/latest.json`.
  - Compares results against committed `baseline.json` for performance regressions.
  - Fails the build automatically if any benchmark exceeds a **10% slowdown threshold**.
- Added automated artifact upload for benchmark results.
- Implemented a resilient Python comparison script with flexible JSON parsing.
- Achieved **complete performance regression tracking coverage** (100% functional).

### ðŸ§± Architecture
- Explicit benchmark runner in `Program.cs` ensures deterministic execution for CI.
- Added absolute artifact paths for consistent cross-platform exports.
- Benchmarks now emit reports to `benchmark-results/results/` and never conflict with baseline data.

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation
- Validated JSON output and regression logic locally and on GitHub Actions.
- Verified export compatibility across .NET 8.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 environments.

## [0.6.0] â€” 2025-10-08
### ðŸ”— Flow.AI.Core Integration
- Integrated official **Flow.AI.Core v0.1.0** package.
- Implemented `Flow.AI.Core.Interfaces.ITokenFlowProvider` within `TokenFlowProvider`.
- Removed temporary placeholder interface from TokenFlow.AI.
- Verified full compatibility with all existing functionality and tests (100% coverage retained).
- TokenFlow.AI is now the core engine of the **Flow.AI ecosystem**, ready for use by downstream packages such as **PromptStream.AI**.

### ðŸ§± Architecture
- TokenFlow.AI now exposes a stable, Flow.AI-compliant provider layer.
- All registry, tokenizer, and costing subsystems remain unchanged.
- Ready for consumption by higher-level Flow projects (PromptStream.AI, DataFlow.AI, ChatFlow.AI).

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Coverage
- All integration tests pass using the new provider interface.
- Maintains 100% line and branch coverage across all projects.
- Verified fallback, shared registry, and exception branches.

### ðŸ“˜ Documentation
- Updated README and docs to reflect Flow.AI.Core integration and PromptStream.AI naming.

## [0.5.0] â€” 2025-10-07
### âœ¨ New Features
- **Advanced Tokenizers** module (`TokenFlow.Tokenizers`) introduced:
  - Added `OpenAITikTokenizer` with full [TiktokenSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TiktokenSharp) support.
  - Added `ClaudeTokenizer` using [SharpToken](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpToken) for Anthropic models.
  - Added `ApproxTokenizer` migration into the new Tokenizers module.
  - Implemented unified `TokenizerFactory` with prefix-based model detection (`gpt-*`, `claude-*`, fallback `approx`).

### ðŸ§± Architecture
- Extracted tokenizer logic from `TokenFlow.AI` into standalone **TokenFlow.Tokenizers** package.
- Introduced modular structure with `Shared`, `OpenAI`, `Claude`, and `Factory` namespaces.
- Benchmarks updated to include all tokenizers for comparative analysis.

### âš¡ Performance & Benchmarks
- Updated `TokenizerBenchmarks` to include OpenAI, Claude, and Approx implementations.
- Added Markdown and HTML exporters for richer reports.

### ðŸ“˜ Documentation

- Updated roadmap and README for milestone completion (`Advanced Tokenizers` âœ…).

### ðŸ§¹ Misc Improvements
- Simplified fallback logic and default model name handling.
- Improved CI/CD metadata and documentation consistency.
